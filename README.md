ellchan_anime

INTRODUCTION

ellchan_anime is an online sketch portfolio displaying a selection of design works.  This is to be updated when new designs and sketches, able to sketch commission works when requested via the site.    

REQUIREMENTS
This module requires no modules.

VISUALS
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

INSTALLATION
This site requires no installation.

USAGE
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

CONFIGURATION
TBC

SUPPORT
Links to send a direct email, online form able to be sent as well

ROADMAP
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
